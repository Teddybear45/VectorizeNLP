Abstract—The  ever-growing  threats  of  fraud  and  security 
incidents  present  many  challenges  to  law  enforcement  and 
organisations across the globe.  This has given rise to the need for 
organisations  to  build  effective  incident  management  strategies, 
which will enhance the company’s reactive capability to security 
incidents.  

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  propose  proactive  activities  an 
organisation  can  undertake  in  order  to  increase  its  ability  to 
respond to security incidents and create a digitally forensic ready 
workplace environment.  

The  study  constitutes  exploratory  research,  with  the  use  of  a 
systematic  literature  review  as  a  basis  to  identify  activities 
relating to a digitally forensic ready environment. 

While  much  has  been  written  about  how  organisations  can 
prepare  to  respond  to  security  incidents,  findings  show  an 
absence  of  a  digital  forensic  readiness  model.    This  paper 
concludes by presenting such a conceptual model.  

This study contributes to the greater body of knowledge on the 
design  and  implementation  of  a  digital  forensic  readiness 
programme,  aimed  at  maximising  the  use  of  digital  evidence  in 
an organisation.

I. 

 INTRODUCTION  

White-collar  crime  is  a  term  that  has  had  common 
occurrence in the news.  To explain it, consider the following 
cases. Towards the end of 1999, the South African government 
signed contracts totalling R30 billion to modernise its defence 
equipment.  The project, “which promised billions of Rands in 
export  and  local  sales,  has  not  happened”  [1].    On  another 
matter,  it  was  reported  that  Randgold  &  Exploration  was 
subject to “massive fraud” equal to R1.5bn by its former CEO 
Brett  Kebble,  who  misappropriated  funds,  forged  documents 
and  was  involved  in  imprudent  deal  making,  according  to  a 
forensic  investigation  [2].    While  these  types  of  cases  do  not 
form part of a typical law enforcement agent’s daily work, they 
do  depict  the  gradually  decaying  ethical  fibre  of  modern-day 
society.  Speculations were that these elaborate crimes would 
end  with  Enron,  and  that  the  business  community  would  use 
the  lessons  learned  and  better  manage  this  great  risk  [3].  
However, this has not been the case.  Many other organisations 
such as WorldCom, Health South, Adelphia and Tyco suffered 
the same tragedy [4]. In trying to understand and measure the 
impact of fraud on organisations, the Association of Certified 
Fraud  Examiners  released  findings  of  a  study  that  a  typical 
organisation  loses  5%  of  its  annual  revenue  to  fraud  [5].  In 

other studies, South Africa was found to have the second-worst 
white-collar crime rate in the world [6].  

The  inherent  risk  of  increased  technical  sophistication  in 
modern crimes makes these security incidents harder to detect, 
thereby  potentially  creating  more  damage  [7].  Additionally, 
technology  now  plays  a  central  role  in  facilitating  and 
enhancing the sophistication of modern security incidents [8]- 
[9].  Over  the  past  decade,  well-understood  procedures  and 
methodologies have evolved within computer forensics digital 
evidence  collection  [10]-[11].    Kenneally  and  Brown  [10] 
further  note:  “Computer  forensic  autopsies  are  no  longer 
performed  on  single  machines  with  small  data  storage 
capacities.  Rather,  the  scope  for  potential  evidence  has 
expanded to networks of interconnected computers, each with 
vast  storage  capacities  containing  potential  artefacts  of  legal 
relevance”.    Available  literature  relating  to  digital  forensic 
readiness  (DFR)  addresses  various  technical  components  of 
this  concept,  but  none  brings  all  the  components  into  one 
framework [12]-[15]. The need for a consolidation of research 
efforts in creating frameworks and models that help to address 
recent  threats  was  recently  identified  by  Garfinkel  [9],  who 
states  that  “without  a  clear  strategy  for  enabling  research 
efforts that build upon one another, forensic research will fall 
behind the market, tools will become increasingly obsolete, and 
law  enforcement,  military  and  other  users  of  computer 
forensics  products  will  be  unable  to  rely  on  the  results  of 
forensic analysis”. 

This  paper  investigates  recent  challenges  that  technology 
presents  with  regard  to  the  reliance  and  admissibility  of 
electronic evidence in a court of law.  A systematic literature 
review was used to gather relevant information and this data is 
critically  analysed  in  order  to  identify  gaps  and  to  improve 
upon them. 

A  section  dedicated  to  explaining  the  scientific  research 
method  adopted  in  this  paper  is  presented  next.    This  is 
followed  by  a  section  on  the  application  of  the  said  research 
method,  in  reviewing  existing  literature  relating  to  digital 
forensics.  Preceding the conclusion is a section that presents 
the conceptual model for DFR. 

II.  RESEARCH METHOD 
literature 

A  systematic 

review  was  used. 

  Unlike 
conventional  literature  review,  a  systematic  review  follows  a 
predefined  protocol.    It  is  defined  as  a  way  to  “identify, 
evaluate and interpret the available research that is relevant to 
an issue or discipline, or phenomenon of interest of a specific 
research  domain”  [16].  Systematic  reviews  require 
the 
researcher  to  systematically  collect  all  the  search  on  a  given 

topic,  select  studies  according  to  pre-determined  quality 
criteria,  abstract  the  same  information  from  each  included 
study,  display  the  results  in  evidence  tables  and  interpret  the 
results in view of the totality of the evidence [17]. 
A.  Scoping 

The scope of our research was limited to material available 
on  the  University  of  South  Africa  Online  Library  [18].    This 
library is said to be one of the largest libraries in Africa, best 
endowed with information sources in access of 1,5 million. The 
library  also  subscribes  to  an  increasing  number  of  electronic 
journals, which are available at all times to Unisa students [18]-
[19]. 

A detailed search of relevant databases was conducted.  The 
relevance  was  determined  by  using  the  library’s  A-Z  list  of 
electronic  resources  [18].  From  this,  only  seven  databases 
containing  the  most  relevant  material  were  selected  and 
analysed  further  for  articles  and  other  publications.    The 
databases were selected on the basis of being classified under 
the following categories: 

 Computing; 
 Law; 
Information Science; and  
Engineering.  

i.  Multidisciplinary; 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
v. 
Furthermore,  the  databases  that  were  used  were  the  ones 
containing  the  majority  of  the  search  hit  results.    The  search 
term  used  was  “digital  forensic”.    This  keyword  was  used  as 
the basis of the search as it relates directly to the topic under 
investigation. 

 Only  English  written  material  published  in  the  last  nine 
years  (2002-2011)  was  considered.  The  reasons  for  this  were 
that, firstly, Unisa’s online library is available in English and 
secondly,  English  is  one  of  South  Africa’s  most  commonly 
spoken language in business, politics and the media [20]-[21].  
As there was no law on digital crimes in South Africa prior to 
the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act in 2002 
[22], only articles written after promulgation of this law were 
taken into consideration. 

The decision for reviewing only articles was based on the 
logic  that  articles  usually  precede  books,  dissertations  and 
theses. Therefore, by looking at articles, content from the latter 
is also covered.  The next section deals with the methodology 
for screening articles for inclusion. 
B.  Screening of articles for inclusion 

Since the application of a systematic literature review was 
intended  not  only  for  publication  purposes  but  also  for 
instrumental  utilisation,  an  additional  task  to  increase  the 
reliability of the screening process was undertaken.   Both the 
authors conducted the screening process on a subset of articles 
independently of each other and then met together to compare 
results.    

In  order  to  ensure  that  this  process  was  scientific,  the 
Cohen’s Kappa (K) interrater was used in measuring reliability 

of this process.   Interrater reliability is the degree of agreement 
between two observers who have independently observed and 
recorded  behaviours  at  the  same  time  [23]-[24].  The  basic 
formula for Cohen’s Kappa (K) used is as computed below: 

Cohen’s Kappa =  PA (0.77) – PC (0.50) 
 
 
Where PA is the observed percentage agreement and PC is 

        1 – PC (0.50) 
   = 0.54 

 
 

the percentage agreement expected [24]. 

The  goal  in  this  study  was  to  produce  a  PA  value  above 
75% from the total reviewed articles.  This was done to ensure 
that all relevant articles were included for detailed review and 
to archive a kappa value above 0.50.   The said kappa goal is 
generally considered to be satisfactory  [23]-[24]. 
Both  authors  met  to  calculate  the  interrater  reliability  by 
calculating a percentage agreement.  This process was repeated 
until the percentage agreement exceeded 75%. Abstracts of 459 
articles  were  reviewed,  resulting  in  the  identification  of  130 
relevant  articles  for  possible  inclusion.    The  review  process 
was refined further and the result was an agreement on the final 
100 articles for inclusion.    

The next section provides a literature overview of DFR.  

III.  DIGITAL FORENSIC READINESS OVERVIEW 

Rapid  changes  and  advances  in  technology  and  related 
crimes have given rise to the need to review and improve on 
digital forensic models and processes.  Gravetter and Forzano 
[25]  also  make  the  observation  that  “unlike  other  forensic 
sciences, digital forensics subject matter continues to evolve, as 
do the techniques”. 

Given recent advances in technology, Bell and Boddington 
[26] argue that it would be imprudent and potentially reckless 
to  rely  on  existing  evidence  collection  processes  and 
procedures.    They  add  “conventional  assumptions  about  the 
behaviour  of  storage  media  are  no  longer  valid”.      Unlike 
traditional storage media, modern storage devices can operate 
under 
the  absence  of  computer 
instructions  [10],  [27].  Such  operations  can  be  highly 
destructive of traditionally recoverable data.  This process has 
the  potential  to  contaminate  evidence  and  can  obfuscate  and 
make validation of digital evidence difficult [10].  

their  own  volition 

in 

For purposes of this study, the use of the term “traditional 
approaches”  denotes  forensic  procedures  undertaken  from  the 
dawn of the computer forensic practice to 2005 [10].  First, the 
basic concept of a traditional approach called dead forensics is 
explained. 
A.  Dead Forensics  

To  meet  the  desired  goal  of  preserving  original  evidence, 
one  of  the  ﬁrst  steps  in  traditional  evidence  collection 
procedures  includes  taking  the  evidence-containing  computer 
system  ofﬂine  and  creating  a  bit-stream  image  of  the  entire 
original evidence disk [10]. 

The process begins with the preservation of digital evidence 
by  pulling  the  power  cord,  in  preparation  for  the  physical 

removal of the storage device for imaging purposes.  Security 
becomes an important consideration to ensure the logical and 
physical  safety  of  the  evidence.    At  the  conclusion  of  the 
imaging  process,  a  hashing  tool  is  used  to  authenticate  the 
forensic  image.    This  is  then  followed  by  the  analysis  and 
reporting phases.   

Recent  studies  show  that  the  well-understood  digital 
forensic procedures and methodologies are evolving [9], [11]. 
The scope for potential evidence has expanded from standalone 
computers to networks of interconnected computers, each with 
vast  storage  capacities  containing  potential  artefacts  of  legal 
relevance,  making  the  dead  forensic  process  increasingly 
obsolete. 
B.  Live Forensics  

Also  known  as  fast  forensics,  this  concept  is  deﬁned  by 
Reyes and Brittson [25] as “those investigative processes that 
are  conducted  within  the  ﬁrst  few  hours  of  an  investigation, 
that  provide  information  used  during  the  suspect  interview 
phase”.  Due  to  the  need  for  information  to  be  obtained  in  a 
relatively  short  time  frame,  fast  forensics  usually  involves  an 
on-site/ﬁeld analysis of the computer system in question. 

 Live  analysis  techniques  use  software  that  existed  on  the 
system during the time frame being investigated. On the other 
hand,  dead  analysis  techniques  don  not  use  software  that 
existed on the system during that time frame [28]. 

Avoiding  contamination  during  the  recovery  process  is 
paramount  and  depends  on  effective,  error-free  data  recovery 
from  digital  devices.    Traditionally,  write-blocking  hardware 
combined with bit-stream image copying processes served this 
purpose.     

Some  fast  forensics  techniques  utilise  Linux  or  other 
forensic boot disks to perform on-scene/site searches and data 
extraction. The boot disks run in memory only and mount the 
hard drives as read only so as not to corrupt the evidence [25]. 
Sutherland  et  al. [29]  ague  that  “there  is  no  way  to  avoid 
making changes, since in order to conduct a live examination it 
is necessary to deploy tools on the live system to capture data, 
and such tools will make changes to the running system”. 
This  argument  was  later  supported  by  Chan  et  al.  [30],  who 
found that current forensic tools are limited by their inability to 
preserve  the  hardware  and  software  state  of  a  system  during 
investigation.  Existing tools can overwrite evidence present in 
memory or alter the contents of the disk causing forensic taint, 
which lowers the integrity of the evidence.  

On  the  other  hand,  taking  a  snapshot  of  the  system  can 
result in a phenomenon known as forensic blurriness, where an 
inconsistent snapshot is captured because the system is running 
while  it  is  being  observed.    Forensic  blurriness  affects  the 
ﬁdelity  and  quantity  of  evidence  acquired  and  can  cast  doubt 
on the validity of the analysis, making the courts more reluctant 
to accept such evidence [30]. 
From the above, the conclusion is made that neither dead nor 
live 
assurance  of  non-
forensics  provide 
forensic 
manipulation.  Therefore, 

sufficient 
if  existing  computer 

procedures  ultimately  render  evidence  inadmissible,  then  the 
need for a redefinition of the methodology is paramount.   
C.  Digital Forensic Technical Challenges 

According  to  Bell  and  Boddington  [26],  “these  long-
established,  internationally  accepted  procedures  even  cover 
situations such as the automated recovery of court-submissible 
evidence which a defendant has previously attempted to delete. 
Indeed, the peculiarity of 'deleted, but not forgotten' data which 
so  often  comes  back  to  haunt  defendants  in  court  is  in  many 
ways a bizarre artefact of hard drive technology”.  

existing  data

(which  makes 

This comes from the reality that traditional hard disks have 
slow  access  speeds  relative  to  their  capacity  for  storage  (the 
latter makes complete erasure very inconvenient), and from the 
fact that there is no performance penalty is incurred for writing 
over 
erasure 
unnecessary).   
This  situation  is  in  the  process  of  changing  [9].    Newer 
technologies such as solid-state drives (SSDs) are much faster 
and  more  complex.    However,  these  complexities  are  not 
limited only to SSDs, but extend to other storage forms, such 
as  raid  arrays,  storage  area  network  (SAN)  and  network 
attached storage (NAS) devices.  

Commensurate changes that need to be made by the digital 
forensic  tool  manufacturers  to  accommodate/address  the  new 
file systems, operating systems and connectivity demands also 
contribute to shorter lifespan of forensic tools [31]. The issue 
of  tools  and  other  technical  resources  becomes  even  more 
pertinent  as  anti-forensic  efforts  continue  to  increase.    Anti-
forensics  can  be  defined  as  “the  movement  to  exploit 
weaknesses in the forensic process or tools” [25]. 
This rising surge of anti-forensic tools and their ease of access 
on the internet directly impacts on any organisation’s ability, or 
lack thereof, to respond effectively to digital crimes [32].  
There is a need to find a balance between the functionality that 
security  applications  provide  (eg.  secure  deletion)  and  the 
reverse  engineering  capability  required  from  digital  forensic 
tools.  Findings show that security applications have advanced 
far beyond digital forensic tools, rendering some forensic tools 
obsolete  against  (anti-forensic)  actions  undertaken  using 
security tools.   
D.   Digital Forensic Readiness 

The  previous  section  provides  evidence  suggesting  that  a 
mature  technical  environment  alone  is  not  the  only  factor 
impacting  on  the  organisation’s  DFR.    In  this  section,  we 
explore  the  concept  of  DFR  and  other  factors  that  have  an 
impact on it.   

Rowlingson [13] defined forensic readiness “as the ability 
of  an  organisation  to  maximise  its  potential  to  use  digital 
evidence  whilst  minimising  the  costs  of  an  investigation”. 
Garcia  [33]  later  modified  this  definition  to  describe  forensic 
readiness as the “art of maximizing the environment's ability to 
collect credible evidence”. 
From the perspective of law enforcement agencies, the forensic 
process begins when the crime has been committed or when a 
crime  has  been  discovered  and  reported.  The  concept  of 

forensic readiness, according to Hoolachan and Glisson [34], is 
that an organisation can pre-empt the occurrence of a crime by 
preparing  the  environment  in  advance  and  in  doing  this, 
organisations  will  benefit  not  only 
instances  where 
prosecution  becomes  an  issue,  but  also  in  limiting  their  own 
business risks. 
a) 

Policies & Procedures 

in 

The business requirement to gather and use digital evidence 
has been recognised in a number of studies. Rowlingson [13] 
notes  that  enterprise  policies  can  enhance  computer  and 
network forensics. While policies are important, they alone will 
not guarantee an organisation’s overall forensic readiness. An 
implementation  plan  (incident  response)  must  be  developed 
and tested.   

and 

involving 

information 

According  to  Jaatun  et  al.  [35],  incident  response  is  the 
to  and  handling  security-related 
process  of  responding 
incidents 
communications 
technology  infrastructure  and  data.  Incident  response  has 
traditionally been rather reactive in nature, focusing mainly on 
technical issues [35]-[36]. An incident can be anything from an 
attack  that  crashes  all  the  servers  and  cuts  off  all  network 
communications to an intrusion that causes no actual damage 
but demonstrates the vulnerability of the organisation's systems 
[36]-[37].  In  the  introduction  of  this  article,  reference  to 
examples  of  high-profile  fraud  cases  relating  to  the  South 
African  government’s  arms  deal,  Brett  Kebble’s  affairs  while 
at  Randgold  and  those  of  international  companies  such  as 
Tyco, Adelphia and WorldCom indicate the damage a poorly 
managed incident can cause. 

Taylor et al. [32] add that “although all security incidents 
should  be  taken  seriously,  they  may  not  all  have  the  same 
severity”.    An  incident  response  plan  should  therefore  deﬁne 
how incident severities will be determined and what this means 
in terms of incident handling.   
b) 
Incident Management 

David [38] suggests that before dealing with “the incidents 
that  have  been  deemed  worthy  of  treatment,  there  are  three 
important steps that should be taken. First, all events should be 
logged,  and  the  logging  should  be  in  as  much  detail  as 
possible”.  This  makes  allowance  for  things  such  as  later 
treatment of the non-priority items, detecting patterns leading 
up  to  incidents,  and  a  ready  source  of  information  regarding 
events that are action items.  

The  second  important  step  is  that  there  should  be  an 
escalating  set  of  responses  when  appropriate.  The  benefits 
derived from this step are what can be called ‘quick and dirty’ 
initial  reactions  to  certain  incidents,  and  provide  follow-up 
actions if the earlier ones fail to accomplish their goals.  

David [38] further suggests that “all events, even those not 
designated  as  incidents  to  be  treated  in  the  incident  response 
plans, should be treated with reasonable promptness, although 
certainly not with the urgency associated with the more serious 
events”.    
If  the  above  steps  are  not  taken  to  stop  the  events  of  lesser 
importance,  those  initiating  these  events  can  continue  doing 

them without fear of reprisal, and might even try more severe 
attacks [37]-[38]. 
c) 

Response Team 

In  an  attempt  to  be  proactive,  many  organisations  form 
incident  response  teams—called  computer  incident  response 
teams  (CIRTs). 
  These  teams  are  made  up  of  trained 
individuals  whose  goal  is  to  be  able  to  react  speedily  to 
occurrences of incidents [39].  
Each 
team  member  covers  a  pre-assigned  area  of 
responsibility,  thus  decreasing  the  amount  of  damage  and 
increasing the likelihood of apprehending the perpetrator of the 
incident  [35]-[36].    An  incident  response  manager,  whose 
responsibility  includes  coordinating  notiﬁcations,  escalations 
and  ensuring  that  the  incident  response  team  is  properly 
assembled, usually leads this team [32]. 

Lamis  [39]  adds  that  “communication  between  team 
members,  internal  departments,  and  external  networks  is 
critical  to  creating  a  resourceful  environment  to  effectively 
combat  and  handle  incident  responses.  An  organization’s 
incident  response  team  may  require  outside  assistance,  which 
costs crucial time and money to select during the incident”. 

While no evidence of a forensic readiness model could be 
found,  critical  components  making  up  such  a  model  can  be 
extrapolated from the literature reviewed. There is a need for a 
consolidation  of  research  efforts  in  creating  frameworks  and 
models  that  help  to  address  recent  threats  and  incidents  [9].   
The  next  section  covers  how  reviewed  literature  on  research 
efforts relating to DFR was consolidated in the development of 
a conceptual model for digital forensic readiness. 

IV.  DIGITAL FORENSIC READINESS CONCEPTUAL MODEL 
From  the  literature  analysis,  the  critical  components  of  a 
DFR model are summarised in Figure 1.  At a macro level, core 
activities  relating  to  DFR  fall  under  four  categories,  namely 
People, Process, Policy and Technology.  Within each category 
are sub-activities which can further be classified into proactive 
and reactive classes.  

Figure 1. Digital forensic readiness conceptual model  

 

From the above discussion, forensic readiness as explained 

by Rowlingson [13] was found to have two main objectives:  

vi. 

vii. 

a) 

  Maximising  an  environment’s  ability  to  collect 
credible digital evidence; and 
  Minimising the cost of forensics during an incident 
response.  
People  

Under the People category are many sub-activities such as 
the hiring of experienced CIRT members, segregation of duties 
and security training and awareness campaigns.  Establishing a 
capability for securely gathering legally admissible evidence is 
a key component of DFR [13]. 

The objective is to ensure that the human resources of an 
organisation all contribute towards the prevention and detection 
of security incidents [14].   

Research  suggests  that  building  a  response  team  should 
involve  many  different  organisational  departments  such  as 
legal  and  public  relations  [32],  [39].  These  additional  parties 
sometimes  include  external  parties  who  provide  support  and 
have skills that may not be present in the organisation.  

External parties should also be readily available to provide 
assistance  to  internal  teams  in  the  event  of  an  incident  [36]-
[37]. 

Although  the  variety  of  staff  involved  generally  varies 
depending  on  the  magnitude  of  the  investigation,  Hoolachan 
and  Glisson  [34]  argue  that  “there  are  a  multitude  of  people 
who  need  to  understand  the  correct  protocol  within  a  digital 
investigation”.   Failure to organise and equip human resources 
with  the  necessary  tools  and  knowledge  can  ultimately 
negatively impact the organisation’s forensic readiness.   

Developing  and  documenting  processes  that  affect  all 
parties involved is key in ensuring that the integrity of evidence 
and the reputation of the organisation remain intact, even after 
the incident.  
b) 

Process 

The  Process  category  is  concerned  with  activities  that 
ensure  the  integrity  of  evidence.    This  includes  ensuring  that 
operational documents such as an incident response plan and a 
forensic  methodology  are  in  place  [34].  This  is  critical  as  it 
provides  the  organisation  with  an  implementation  guide  to 
meeting  the  requirements  set  by  regulatory  framework  and 
organisational policies.   

Von Solms et al. [14] summarise the four key activities of 

the digital forensic process:  

i. 
ii. 

iii. 

Securing the evidence without contaminating it,  
Acquiring the evidence without altering or damaging 
the original,  
Authenticating that the recovered evidence is the same 
as the original seized data, and  
Analysing the data without modifying it.  

iv. 
The  procedures  for  evidence  acquisition  and  preservation 
can be simple, rapid and effective, saving time and money [40]. 

The complexities of modern network environments, however, 
demand that organisations define the details well ahead of time. 
Failing to preserve the integrity of data on a victim or attacking 
systems in a timely manner will negatively affect the outcome 
of the investigation.  

It  is  therefore  important  to  have  defined  processes  that 
guide  the  organisation  in  achieving  a  digitally  forensic  ready 
environment. 
these  processes  should  be 
governed by certain policies and guiding principles to chart the 
course of action in the event of an incident.  
c)

Rowlingson [13] notes that enterprise policies can enhance 
computer  and  network  forensics.  In  addition,  he  proposes  six 
forensic 
categories 
digital 
investigations.  These  categories  are  designed 
to  help 
enterprises  deter  computer  crime  and  position  themselves  to 
respond  to  successful  attacks  by  improving  their  ability  to 
conduct  investigations.  The  six  categories  of  policies  that 
facilitate digital forensic investigations are:  
viii. 

ix. 

x. 

xi. 

xii. 

xiii. 

Retaining  information  –  Policies  that  relate  to  the 
storage of information by an organisation;  
Planning  the  response  –  Policies  that  guide  the 
organisation’s  plans  to  respond  to  various  incidents 
and situations;  
Training  –  Policies  that  address  the  training  of  staff 
members and those affiliated with the organisation;  
  Accelerating the investigation – Policies that address 
operational aspects of investigations;  
  Preventing  anonymous  activities  –  Policies  that 
address the organisation’s proactive efforts against the 
risk of fraud; and 
  Protecting  the  evidence  –  Policies  that  address  the 
handling  and  protection  of  evidence  and  other  vital 
data. 

Grobler  and  Louwrens  [15]  argue  that  digital  forensics 
policies  may  augment  some  information  security  policies, 
suggesting  that  interdependencies  between  policies  will  exist.  
As  such,  these  policies  must  not  be  developed  in  silos,  but 
should inform one another. 

While policies are important, they alone will not guarantee 
an organisation’s overall forensic readiness. Technology is the 
ultimate  enabler,  ensuring  that  People  have  proactive  and 
reactive  tools  to  implement  as  guided  by  Policy  and  defined 
Processes.  
d) 

Technology 

An  organisation  needs 

that  appropriate 
technology is used not only to enable business operations, but 
to also prevent and detect computer incidents.    

to  ensure 

To provide more clarity on the role of technology or system 
forensic  readiness,  Tan  et  al.  [40]  present  the  idea  of  system 
forensic  readiness  as  one  part  of  overall  enterprise  forensic 
readiness.  It is critical for organisations to know their sources 

of potential evidence and to determine what currently happens 
to the potential evidence data [13]. 

How logging is done; 

Evidence  preservation  is  not  only  affected  by  technical 
factors.    Tan  [12]  argues  that  non-technical  factors  for 
consideration also include: 
xiv. 
xv.  What is logged; 
xvi. 
xvii. 
xviii. 

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs); 
Forensic acquisition; and 
Evidence handling. 

According  to  Doherty  and  Liebesfeld  [31],  more  private 
investigators  are  declining  various  digital  forensic  work 
because the needed and required tools are very expensive and 
have  a  short  lifespan,  due  to  the  increasing  and  changing 
variety of digital devices available on the market each year.  

The  issue  of  tools  and  other  technical  resources  becomes 
even  more  pertinent  as  the  anti-forensic  efforts  continue  to 
increase.  Anti-forensics, as explained above, can be defined as 
“the movement to exploit weaknesses in the forensic process or 
tools” [25]. It can also involve the various acts of hiding data 
from  the  forensic  exam.  Older  techniques  were  as  simple  as 
running a simple script to perform a touch command on every 
ﬁle  to  alter  file  attributes  (date  and  time  stamps),  or  deleting 
log and temporary ﬁles [41].

It  is  therefore  important  to  incorporate  digital  forensic 
toolsets 
technology 
infrastructure.      By  including  some  aspects  of  DFR  into  the 
information security architecture of the organisation, it will be 
possible to link the source of the attack to the incident and the 
perpetrator  [15].  This  integration  of  digital  forensics  in  the 
architecture  design  will  help  to  bridge  the  gap  between 
advances  in  security  applications  and  challenges  that  digital 
forensic tools face.  

As can be extrapolated from the definition of DFR, efforts 
to  ensure  availability  and  integrity  of  data  are  central  to 
maximising  the  organisation’s  ability  to  collect  credible 
evidence to facilitate an investigation [33]-[34].  Studies have 
also  shown  that  DFR  activities  relating  to  data  benefit 
organisations not only in instances where prosecution becomes 
an  issue,  but  also  in  limiting  an  organisation’s  own  business 
risks [13], [34]. 

V.  VALUE PROPOSITION 

As discussed, the increasing sophistication of incidents can 
cause  great  harm  to  an  organisation.    While  numerous 
organisations  have  policies,  human  resources  and  technical 
tools, many of these efforts are modelled in a way that supports 
business functions and not necessarily DFR.   

The  proposed  conceptual  DFR  model  provides  a  platform 
for proactive activities to be consolidated and concentrated to 
ensure  collaboration  within  the  organisation  in  building 
capacity to prevent, detect and manage incidents.  
Additionally, the model can be used to provide a dashboard of 
all related organisational activities, classified under each of the 

four  components  of  People,  Process,  Policy  and  Technology.  
Once complete, this classification can be used to measure the 
maturity of how ready the organisation is to deal with security 
incidents.    This  will  further  aid  in  reducing  duplication  of 
activities geared towards achieving DFR. 
VI.  CONCLUSION 

The aim of this paper was to propose proactive activities an 
organisation  can  undertake  in  order  to  increase  its  ability  to 
respond  to  security  incidents  and  create  a  digitally  forensic 
ready workplace environment. This was done by investigating 
recent  challenges  that  technology  presents  with  regard  to  the 
reliance and admissibility of electronic evidence in a court of 
law.  A systematic literature review was used to gather relevant 
information  and  this  data  was  critically  analysed  in  order  to 
identify gaps and to fill them. 

Findings  show  that  available  literature  relating  to  DFR 
addresses  various  technical  components  of  this  concept,  but 
none brings all the components into one framework.  The need 
for a consolidation of research efforts in creating frameworks 
and  models  that  help  to  address  recent  threats  was  also 
discussed  and  the  outcome  is  a  proposed  conceptual  DFR 
model, which can be used as a tool to consolidate and integrate 
segregated  business  activities  which  form  part  of  DFR.    The 
model  also 
that  are 
necessary to achieve DFR. In the absence of such a model, an 
organisation  will  not  be  able  to  maximise  the  environment's 
ability to collect credible evidence. 

identifies  four  critical  components 

Literature reviewed shows that fraud and security incidents 
affect organisations across the public and private sector.  This 
research adds value by highlighting the impact of technological 
advances  on  traditional  digital  forensic  processes.  Included  is 
the emphasis on the sophistication of recent security incidents 
and  the  importance  of  a  DFR  model  to  aid  organisations  in 
aligning  efforts  that  ensure  that  credible  evidence  can  be 
retained during normal business operations.   

A  limitation  of  this  research  is  that  it  presents  only  a 
conceptual model, which is generic in nature. Further research 
opportunities are in building on the proposed conceptual model 
by  identifying  the  different  stakeholders  in  an  investigation 
process,  and  personalising 
their  varying 
environments.    Additionally,  sub-activities  within  each  of  the 
identified  components  of  the  model  can  be  investigated  in 
greater detail, to include testing of recent forensic and security 
tools  that  can  be  used  to  address  technological  advances 
discussed earlier in this paper.
