Abstract—Research  on  internet  users  reports  a  gap  between 
reported privacy concerns and observed privacy behavior. This gap 
has also been reported on social networking sites like Facebook and 
MySpace.  This  current  study  explores  the  extent  of  this  gap  by 
examining  individual  Facebook  components.  Unlike  the  previous 
studies  that  have  explored  reported  privacy  concerns  versus 
observed  behavior,  this  study  explores  claimed 
information 
disclosure versus observed information disclosure. A questionnaire 
was  used  to  examine  the  reported  information  disclosure  and 
observations  on  public  Facebook  profiles  were  conducted  to 
examine  the  actual  behavior.  The  study  shows  that  there  is  a  gap 
between 
information  disclosure  and  observed 
disclosure,  like  in  the  case  of  reported  privacy  concern  versus 
observed  behavior.  However,  this  study  shows  that  the  users  act 
more securely than they claim to act.

INTRODUCTION 

Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and 
the like have given people the ability to communicate and share 
information  with  almost  anyone,  anywhere  and  at  any  time.  An 
important  aspect  of  social  networking  sites  is  the  fact  that  users 
can  publish  status  updates,  upload  photos,  audio  files  and  video 
files  for  their  friends  to  view.  However,  users  often  publish 
information  about  themselves  that  is  extremely  personal  or 
sensitive  [1].  Although  privacy  settings  can  be  used  to  protect 
private information, it is often  found that  users do not use these 
privacy settings [1], [2].  

For  the  purpose  of  this  study  focus  is  put  on  Facebook. 
Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and 
has  the  largest  number  of  users.  As  of  January  2011,  Facebook 
had  more  than  600  million  active  users  [3].  This  number 
increased in the same  year to 800  million users  [4].  This  makes 
Facebook  the  most  popular  social  networking  site  and  more 
popular than Google  as the most  visited site  on the Internet [5]. 
Facebook  is  the  biggest  photo  site,  even  bigger  than  Flickr  or 
Photobucket [6]. 

Facebook  started  as  a  social  networking  site  of  Harvard 
University  in  2004  created  by  Mark  Zuckerberg.  As  with  all 
social  networking  sites,  participation  requires  a  user  to  create  a 
profile that lists the demographics of the user, a profile photo and 
requires that a user be above 13 years old. In addition, after users 
are signed on they can share different information types that can 

be updated at any time. Contributing to the success of Facebook 
is  the  developer  platform  which  was  launched  in  2007.  The 
developer platform enabled the development of applications that 
can be used directly or indirectly to interact with the application 
servers  through  Facebook  [7].  These  applications  have  been 
labeled to increase the risk of data harvesting [8]. 

The  ease  of  information  storage  on  the  Internet  makes  it 
possible  for  user  information  to  be  harvested  later.    This 
information  may  then  be  used  in  situations  where  it  can  be 
harmful  to  the  owner  [9].  Scholars,  the  media  and  many  other 
privacy  stakeholders  have  raised  concerns  regarding  the  risks 
associated  with  the  disclosure  of  personal  information  on  social 
networking  sites  [1],  [10–12].  Research  on  internet  users  has 
shown that users claim that privacy is important to them, but do 
not act likewise [13], [14]. This has also been debated to be  the 
same case on social networking sites users  [15], [16], [17] [18]. 
All  these  studies  focused  on  the  privacy  concerns  versus 
observed  behavior.  This  gap  between  privacy  concerns  and 
observed  behavior  is  termed  as  “privacy  paradox”  [19].  Other 
well-known  studies  in  this  field  include  [1],  [10],  [11],  these 
studies  focused  on  the  amount  and  type  of  information  users 
disclosed and on the reported privacy concerns or preferences.    

This  current  study  puts  focus  on  the  claimed  information 
disclosure  versus observed  information  disclosure.  According  to 
our  knowledge  this  is  the  first  study  to  focus  on  the  users’ 
claimed  behavior,  rather  than  claimed  privacy  preferences  as 
previous studies have. This research will add to the existing body 
of  knowledge  within  privacy  studies,  predominantly  within  the 
rapidly  growing  area  of  studying  human  behavior  on  social 
networking  sites.  This  study  formulated  the  following  research 
question: 

Is  there  a  gap  between  claimed  information  disclosure  and 
observed information disclosure on Facebook? 

The following sections will discuss the methods employed in 
arriving at the results of this study. The results will be discussed, 
followed  by  the  discussion  of  future  work  and  the  conclusion. 
First we start by discussing the participants of the study.  

II.  RESEARCH METHODS  

The 

for 

research  methods  chosen 

this  study  were 
questionnaires  and  observations.  Questionnaires  were  used  to 
understand  the  claimed  information  disclosure  on  Facebook. 
Requests to respond to the questionnaire were made via e-mail to 

all  the  recruited  participants.  Two  participants  failed  to  receive 
the invitation because they provided invalid e-mail addresses. Of 
the  167  requests  made,  100  participants  responded  to  the 
questionnaire,  giving  a  61%  response  rate.  To  examine  the 
observed information disclosure, observations were made on the 
users’ public Facebook profiles. A total of 131 participants were 
observed  at  a  Facebook  component-level.  We  approached  this 
study  on  a  component  base.  Participants  were  asked  to  indicate 
all the Facebook components they had disclosed on their profiles. 
During  observations  all  those  components  were  observed  to 
identify the gap for each component.  

All data collection took place during the month of September 
2011.  During  data  collection  we  adopted  the  classifications  of 
Facebook components that Nosko, Wood and Molema described 
in  2010  [20].  They  categorized  Facebook  components  into  the 
following three categories: 

1.  Personal 

identifiable 

information:  This 

to 
hometown,  gender,  birthday,  birth  year,  e-mail  address, 
address, profile photo, photos, and personal website. This is 
any  information  about  an  individual  that  can  be  used  to 
distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity or linkable to an 
individual [21].  

refers 

2.  Sensitive  personal  information:  This  refers  to  employer 
information,  secondary  school,  university,  current  location, 
mobile  number,  friends’  list  and  relationship  status.  This  is 
any  personally  revealing or sensitive information that could 
be used to locate an individual and could be used to threaten 
or harm the owner.  

3.  Potentially  stigmatizing  information:  This  refers  to  the 
wall, religious status, political views, people who inspire me, 
favorite  quotations,  music,  books,  movies,  television  show, 
games, sport, activities, interests, gender interested in dating, 
language  and  personal  description.  This  is  any  information 
that could result in stigmatization within the society.  

Our  methodology  differs  from  the  previous  studies  in  the 
sense  that  we  tested  our  research  question  for  each  Facebook 
component.

PARTICIPANTS 

recruitment  167  participants 

Participants  in  this  study  were  freshmen  enrolled  for  IT  at 
Nelson  Mandela  Metropolitan  University  for  the  academic  year 
of  2011.  During 
indicated 
willingness  to  participate  in  the  study  by  signing  a  participation 
form.  Ethical  clearance  was  obtained  before  data  collection  and 
participation  in  the  study  was  voluntary.  Fig.  1  shows  the 
classification of participants at different stages of the study. The 
participants that took part in each stage of the study are explained 
on  the  relevant  sections  below.  The  gray  area  depicts  the 
probability  of  participants  that  filled  the  questionnaire  and  were 
also observed. Possibility is that some participants that completed 
the  questionnaire  were  not  observed  and  some  that  did  not 
complete  the  questionnaire  were  observed.  Table  2  gives  the 
groupings  of  the  participants  during  observations.  The  table 

explains  all  the  information  disclosed  by  each  group  and  the 
number of participants that were in that group.

IV.  RESULTS 

 

Males  dominated  the  sample,  with  75%  while  females 
registered 25%.  A variety of age groups were represented in the 
sample, ages 18 – 21 dominated the sample with 91%, with ages 
22 – 25 and 26 – 30 on 7% and 2% respectively. The majority of 
the participants (63%) have used Facebook for more than a year 
and 37% have used Facebook for less than a year. The full results 
of the claimed information disclosure are given in Table 1.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

B.  Observations  

Of the 167 participants recruited 35 participants could not be 
found  on  Facebook  and  one  participant  was  deemed  invalid  as 
she was already a Facebook friend of the researcher. As we could 
not  determine 
the  behavior  regarding  specific  Facebook 
components  of  the  21%  that  could  not  be  found,  they  were 
disregarded for the rest of the observation. However, if they were 
using  a  pseudonym  they  could  still  be  exposing  the  detail 
components to relative strangers who might still identify them.  

Table  1  gives  the  full  results  of  the  claimed  information 
disclosure  versus  observed  information  disclosure.  The  table 
provides the list of Facebook items examined on the first column. 
The second and the third columns show the claimed information 
disclosure  and  the  observed  information  disclosure  respectively. 
The  last  column  gives  the  difference  between  the  claimed 
information  disclosure  and  the  observed  information  disclosure. 
As  an  example,  for  hometown,  92%  claimed  that  they  have 
disclosed  it  on  their  profiles,  while  61%  were  observed  to  have 
disclosed  it  on  their  profiles.  Therefore  the  difference  between 
claimed  disclosure  and  observed  disclosure 
is  31%.  The 
information in Table 1 is represented in three figures according to 
the  difference  between  the  claimed  information  disclosure  and 
observed information disclosure.

Fig.  2  shows  the  difference  between  claimed  information 
disclosure  and  observed  information  disclosure  for  components 
that  had  more  than  50%  difference.  All  the  components  in  this 
figure  show  that  users  acted  more  securely  than  they  claimed. 
The  observed  information  disclosure  is  less  than  claimed 
information  disclosure.  This  is  counterintuitive  and  contrary  to 
popular  studies.  In  the  case  of  reported  privacy  behavior  versus 
observed  privacy  behavior,  most  studies  revealed  that  users  act 
less securely  than their privacy  preferences. However, the result 
of this group suggests otherwise. A discussion on the reasons that 
might cause this is discussed with the results of the study on the 
discussion section below. 

 

 

 

Figure 1.Components with more than 50% difference between claimed and 

observed disclosure 

Fig.  3  shows  the  difference  between  claimed  information 
disclosure  and  observed  information  disclosure  for  components 
that had a difference between 31% - 50%. All the components in 
this group show that users acted more securely than they claimed. 
Again,  the  result  of  this  group  gives  a  different  finding  than 
previous studies. 

 

case of reported privacy  concern  and observed privacy  behavior 
[15–17],  there  is  a  gap  between  claimed  information  disclosure 
and  observed  information  disclosure.  The  gap  was  found  for  all 
Facebook components except for the friends list. 

 

All  the  previous  studies  have  argued  that  users  of  social 
networking  sites  report  that  privacy  is  important  to  them  but  do 
not  act  according  to  their  privacy  preferences.  However,  in  the 
case  of  claimed  behavior  this  study  shows  that  users  act  more 
securely than what they claim. This is counterintuitive to popular 
views brought about the forerunner studies in this field. Keep in 
mind  that  this  study  examined  a  different  variable  than  the 
previous  studies.  This  counterintuitive  finding  can  be  attributed 
to a number of reasons and these are discussed below. 

The  first  reason  might  be  that  this  study  is  examining  a 
different  variable  than  the  previous  studies.  The  methodology 
used  in  this  study  is  not  the  same  as  the  previous  studies  in  the 
sense  that  this  study  examined  the  gap  for  each  Facebook 
component. This study extends that the gap is not only on privacy 
concerns  versus  observed  privacy,  but  also  found  on  claimed 
information  disclosure  versus  observed  information  disclosure. 
Research in other fields like organizational behavior research has 
found that users are bias in self-report. They tend to under-report 
behaviors  deemed 
researchers  or  other 
observers,  and  they  tend  to  over-report  behaviors  viewed  as 
appropriate [22]. We do not rule out the possibility of this theory 
in this study as well.  

inappropriate  by 

Another reason would be that the users are not really aware of 
who currently  can  view  what information on their profiles.  This 
maybe  because  users  have  not  revisited  their  privacy  settings 
after  all  the  changes  Facebook  has  done  on  the  site’s  privacy 
settings.  Therefore,  users  might  be  unaware  of  their  disclosure. 
Research over the years have argued that most users rarely  alter 
default settings [1], [23–25]. This might also be the case also for 
the participants of this study.  

Another cause might be that the users might be sharing their 
information  with  friends  and  not  with  strangers.  This  study  was 
approached  from  a  stranger  point  of  view.  Therefore  we  could 
only observe what a normal stranger would see. We would have 
wanted to examine the gap from a Facebook friend point of view, 
but the ethical clearance we got from the University only limited 
us to stand on a stranger point of view. Table 2 shows that only 
12%  of  the  participants  we  were  able  to  observe  all  possible 
Facebook  components  on  their  profiles.  47%  of  the  participants 
had  somewhat  open  profiles  while  the  rest  yielded  little  to  no 
information. From all the participants it is interesting to note that 
21%  of  participants  were  not  disclosing  information  that  could 
easily  be  associated  with  by  a  stranger.  It  is  assumed  that  the 
participants  maybe  using  pseudonym  names  and  that  maybe 
another form of privacy protection mechanism. 

Additionally,  both  the  number  of  the  participants  that 
returned the questionnaire and the participants that were observed 
are less than the number of participants recruited. This makes it a

Fig.  4  shows  the  difference  between  claimed  information 
disclosure  and  observed  information  disclosure  for  components 
that  had  a  difference  that  is  less  than  30%.  The  results  on  this 
group  show  that  users  acted  more  securely  than  they  claimed 
with  the  exception  of  friends  list.  The  friends  list  was  the  only 
Facebook component where the observed information disclosure 
scored more than  claimed information disclosure. The following 
section will discuss the results of the study.

V.  DISCUSSION  

This  study  conducted  an  exploration  in  which  we  contrasted 
self-reported/claimed  information  disclosure  against  observed 
information  disclosure  of  Facebook  users.  Our  preliminary 
research  question  was  to  examine  if  there  is  a  gap  between 
claimed 
information 
disclosure on Facebook. This study discovered that, as it is in the 

information  disclosure  and  observed 

possibility  that some  participants that were observed did not fill 
the questionnaire and some that filled the questionnaire were not 
observed. Again, our ethical clearance did not allow us to collect 
names during the questionnaire stage and we could not verify that 
the participants we observed are exactly the same as the ones that 
administered 
recruited 
participants  filled  the  questionnaire.  Both  the  reasons  for  filling 
the questionnaire and not filling the questionnaire are unknown to 
the researchers.   

the  questionnaire.  Again,  not  all 

Lastly,  we did not  specify  to the participants the perspective 
we  were  questioning  their  information  disclosure  from.  The 
participants  could have misunderstood the question to think that 
we  were  asking  from  a  Facebook  friend’s  point  of  view.  The 
following  section  concludes  the  study  and  also  discusses  future 
work.  

VI.  CONCLUSION 

Social  networking  sites  provide  users  with  a  platform  to 
create  maintain  online  social  networks  and  share  information. 
Along  with  the  benefits  of  social  networking  sites  there  are 
threats, risks and privacy concerns with sharing information with 
large amounts of people. The privacy implications on these sites 
are the cause scholars put effort to carefully study these sites. The 
results of this study  contribute to the  body  of  knowledge  within 
the  rapidly  growing  area  of  social  networking  sites.  There  are 
many  reasons  for  the  discrepancy  between  claimed  information 
disclosure 
information  disclosure.   This 
unpredictable  behavior  adds  to  the  difficulty  that  developers  of 
social networking sites have in catering to the privacy needs and 
concerns of all their users 

and  observed 

Not only does the study present a counterintuitive result, but 
it  examines  a  different  variable  using  a  different  methodology 
than  previous  studies.  Again,  future  study  will  look  to  compare 
the  individual’s  questionnaire  results  and  the  observations.  We 
could  not  do  this  because  the  questionnaire  was  on  anonymous 
basis 

In  evaluating  the  results  of  this  study,  certain  limitations 
should be taken into consideration. Firstly, this only observed the 
participants from a stranger point of view. Future work will look 
to observe participants from  a  Facebook  friend point of  view to 
determine if the gap will still be present or decreased.  

This  study  could  not  determine  if  the  participants  that  filled 
the  questionnaire  were  the  same  as  the  participants  observed. 
Future  study  will  look  to  observe  the  same  participants  as  the 
ones that filled the questionnaire.
