Abstract—The potential impact that data leakage can have on a 
country, both on a national level as well as on an individual level, 
can  be  wide  reaching  and  potentially  catastrophic.  In  January 
2013,  several  South  African  companies  became  the  target  of  a 
hack attack, resulting in the breach of security measures and the 
leaking of a claimed 700000 records.  The affected companies are 
spread across a number of domains, thus making the leak a very 
wide impact area.  The aim of this paper is to analyze the data 
released  from  the  South  African  breach  and  to  visualize  the 
extent  of  the  loss  by  the  companies  affected.  The  value  of  this 
work lies in its connection to and interpretation of related South 
African  legislation.  The  data  extracted  during  the  analysis  is 
primarily personally identifiable information, such as defined by 
the  Electronic  Communications  and  Transactions  Act  of  2002 
and the Protection of Personal Information Bill of 2009.

I. 

 INTRODUCTION  

The  recent  breach  of  South  African  companies’  security 
measures  has  released  a  trove  of  South  African  personal 
information  to  the  Internet.  Although  small  by  international 
standards  when  compared  with  breaches  such  as  the  incident 
that  saw  Sony  lose  an  estimated  77  million  records  [1],  the 
South  African  incident  saw  as  much  as  700000  records 
exposed [2]. The number seems large but does little to describe 
the  real  value  of  the  data  lost:  the  dumped  data  ranges  from 
government,  banking,  mining,  petroleum,  transport  services, 
management,  networking,  construction,  education  and  other 
enterprises, making this leak a very wide impact area [2]. 

The aim of this paper is to analyze the data released from 
the breach and visualize what has been lost by the companies 
affected.  The value  of  this work  lies  in  its  connection  to  and 
interpretation  of  related  South  African  legislation.  The  data 
extracted  during 
is  primarily  personally 
identifiable  information,  such  as  defined  by  the  Electronic 
Communications and Transactions (ECT) Act of 2002 and the 
Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Bill of 2009. 

the  analysis 

The paper will look at the impact areas of visualizing data 
and  what  can  be  considered  as  personally 
identifiable 
information according to South African regulations.  It further 
provides  an  overview  and  brief  analysis  of  the  publicly 
available data obtained as a result of the data leak.  The paper 
concludes with a discussion on why it is deemed important to 
protect  private  information,  and  how  this  data  leak  serves  as 

warning  to  South  African  organizations  that  better  security 
controls are required. 

II.  THE IMPACT OF VISUALIZING DATA 

Assessing  the  impact  of  visualizing  data  leakage  is  fairly 
difficult to determine.  Based on the literature reviewed by the 
authors, three possible impact areas can be  identified.  These 
are listed below and discussed thereafter. 

  Human emotions. 
  Complex datasets. 
  Processing of unstructured data sources. 
The effect of human emotions is demonstrated in a recent 
case in America. Reporters from the Journal News newspaper 
took  publicly  available  text-based  information  of  all  gun-
owners  in  the  New  York  area  and  plotted  it  to  an  interactive 
Google map to visually display the data.  Although the data has 
been available for years, the act of visualizing the data sparked 
intense  uproar  with  the  newspaper  receiving  almost  2000 
letters  of  protest  and  experiencing  retaliation  against  their 
reporters [3]. 

Researchers  are  well  aware  that  humans  have  difficulty 
grasping  complex  datasets  without  prior  exposure.    As  such, 
there  are  several  studies  already  underway  to  improve  the 
visualization field [4]. This trend is completely understandable 
when the work of Grady [5] is taken into account. Her research 
concluded  that  the  human  brain  dedicates  almost  30%  of  its 
capacity  to  sight  with  the  closest  other  sense,  the  sense  of 
touch, only utilizing 8% of the brain’s capacity. In her findings, 
Grady  explains  that  humans  are  exceptionally  gifted  at 
evaluating  visual  input  and  making  decisions  based  on  what 
they see. Work conducted by Bertini and Lalanne [6] supports 
this  theory  with  their  results  when  they  investigated  the 
complementary  role  of  data  analysis  and  visualization 
techniques and found that human operators in data rich areas 
achieved  a  higher  degree  of  understanding  regarding  their 
environment  with 
the  help  of  computer  visualization 
techniques.  

Unfortunately as Marty [7] highlights, the biggest problem 
with visualization is not the actual data display since there are 
many  gifted  artists  available,  but  the  processing  of  the 
unstructured  data  sources.  To  this  extent  researchers  such  as 
Loukissas  and  Mindell  [8]  are  performing  research  on  the 
viability of a visual language with syntax and semantics. 

impact  people’s  understanding 

As such, the impact of the data leak in South Africa, and 
the  visual  representation  thereof,  is  in  particular  difficult  to 
measure.  At the time of writing, the extent of the data leak was 
not  yet  publicly  visualized,  thus  it  is  not  clear  how  human 
emotions  may 
thereof.  
Therefore,  the  first  impact  area,  human  emotions,  is  not 
applicable  in  this  specific  instance.    The  second  impact  area, 
complex datasets, is satisfied, given that the data leak affected 
at least 14 different companies in various sectors of business, 
all with their own structure and semantic nuances; it can thus 
be said that it created a data rich environment. Unfortunately 
since the data is from various companies, the structure of the 
data is completely different and presents a number of analysis 
problems.    This  satisfied  the  third  impact  area,  processing  of 
unstructured data sources.  The remainder of this paper looks 
into the type of information that was leaked and the potential 
impact that this leaked data have on various entities. 

III.  PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION  

According  to  South  African  legislation,  the  definition  of 

personal information is extensive and includes the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to 

to 

the 

relating 

information  relating  to  an  identifiable,  living  natural 
person and, where applicable, an identifiable, existing 
juristic person; 
information 
race,  gender,  sex, 
pregnancy,  marital  status,  national,  ethnic  or  social 
origin, color, sexual orientation, religion, age, physical 
or  mental  health,  well-being,  disability,  conscience, 
belief, culture, language and birth of the person;  
information  relating 
the  education,  financial, 
medical, criminal or employment history of the person; 
any 
identifying  number,  symbol,  email  address, 
physical address, telephone number or other particular 
assignment to the person; 
the  blood  type  or  any  other  biometric  information  of 
the person; 
the  personal  opinions,  view  or  preferences  of  the 
person; 
correspondence sent by the person that is implicitly or 
explicitly of a private or confidential nature; and 
the  view  or  opinions  of  another  individual  about  the 
person  and  the  name  of  the  person  if  it  appears  with 
other personal information relating to the person or if 

the  disclosure  of 
information about the person [9][10]. 

the  name 

itself  would  reveal 

In  essence,  any  piece  of  information  that  can  be  either 
directly or indirectly linked to the identity of a specific person 
can be regarded as personally identifiable information.  Due to 
the sensitive nature of many of these pieces of information, the 
first identified impact area of visualizing data, human emotions 
(refer to Section II), plays an important part.  The next section 
presents an overview of the personally identifiable information 
that was leaked in this particular instance. 

IV.  ANALYSIS OF THE DATA OBTAINED 

Team GhostShell announced on 28 January 2013 that they 
have obtained data leaked from South African companies. The 
proclaimed  reason  for  the  data  leak  attack  was  to  retaliate 
against corruption in the South African government and to send 
a message that corruption will be uncovered [11]. Although the 
text  was  worded  in  both  English  and  Afrikaans,  it  is  clearly 
visible that Google Translate was used to translate the English 
text  to  Afrikaans.  This  initially  gives  the  attack  a  local 
perception but could simply be due to a smart attacker that did 
his research regarding the country’s languages. 

The  data  was  posted  on  various  paste  sites  such  as 
http://textsnip.com  and  http://everfall.com  with  each  dataset 
posted on more than one paste site to create redundancy in case 
one paste site removed the data. As at 14 April 2013, all data 
sources  were  still  available  for  all  companies  affected  by  the 
breach.  Some  paste  sites  contained  a  modification  to  the 
primary trunk of the data so that a less technical operator might 
mistakenly think the data has been removed. It should be noted 
that no verification of the data available was given by any of 
the  companies  involved  and  as  such  should  not  be  trusted  as 
100% accurate. The focus of the paper is only to analyze the 
content of the purported breach, highlighting the difficulties in 
assessing the data leaked. 

According  to  the  analysis  performed  by  the  authors,  the 
attack  itself  seems  to  have  been  conducted  via  Structured 
Query  Language  (SQL)  injection  techniques.    The  authors 
found artifacts of the software Acunetix (used to perform SQL 
injections) in the data and the data format of more than one of 
the datasets posted on the various paste sites.  Acunetix has a 
freeware  version  of  the  software  available  to  the  public,  and 
since  it  is  widely  used,  it  cannot  indiscriminately  lead  to  the 
identity of the attackers. Table I presents a summary analysis of 
the leaked data.

From the analysis performed and presented in Table I the 
following personally identifiable information was extracted by 
the authors: 

5107 identifiable physical addresses. 
18004 telephone numbers. 
11703 unique username and password combinations. 
19849 South African ID numbers. 
1641 tertiary and secondary school education details. 
45721 email addresses. 
1632 marriage statuses.

One  of  the  surprise  findings of  the  data  analysis  was  that 
although  the  breach  was  touted  as  a  South  African  breach,  it 
affected quite a number of companies and people outside the 
South  African  borders,  as  depicted  in  Figure  1.  This  has  an 
impact  on  several  areas.    For  example,  although  some  of  the 
leaked  data  might  not  at  first  glance  be  considered  as 
personally  identifiable  information  since  it  relates  to  publicly 
known  business  addresses,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  place 
where 
the  data  was  obtained  can  make  a  significant 
contribution to the value of the data. Since the leaked business 

 

addresses were located in a database and linked with a South 
African  business  address,  the  implied  fact  is  that  the  one 
business would be acting as the supplier and the other business 
acting as the consumer. With this knowledge a competitor can 
already determine the potential supplier list of a competitor’s 
business and potentially gain an unfair advantage.  

When focusing more on the information related directly to 
South  Africa,  the  leaked  data  shows  that  the  affected 
companies  have  definite  space  for  improvement  in  terms  of 
their information security measures. For example, passwords in 
databases  were  predominantly  stored  in  clear  text  and  when 
encryption  was  used,  it  was  mostly  plain  MD5.  Most  of  the 
MD5  encrypted  passwords  could  be  decrypted  with  a  simple 
Google query and translated to either “admin” or “1234”. No 
other  fields  except  session  cookies  were  encrypted  at  all, 
making the theft of personal information all the more viable to 
an  attacker.  Figure  2  depicts  the  address  information  that  is 
available in the dataset within the South African borders. The 
authors  made  use  of  the  Google  Streetview  Application 
Programming Interface (API) to plot the data for both Figure 1 
and  Figure  2.    This  provides  the  ability  to  zoom  in  to  street 
level to look at the residence of a target, further visualizing the 
extent of the data breach and perceived violation of personally 
identifiable information.

V. 

INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE LEAKED DATA 

As an example of the type of information that can be deduced 
from a data leak of this magnitude, Table II compares the most 
commonly used passwords from the leaked South African data 
with  AVG  Australia’s  published  list  of  most  commonly  used 
passwords [12]. Although the South African list shows skewed 
results (for example, the 213 instances of the password omni-
id),  Table  II  provides  valuable  insight  into  South  African 
information  security  practices.  (This  high  occurrence  relates 
directly to the dataset used - the password omni-id was preset 
as a user’s default password upon account creation within one 
of the affected companies. Due to the volume of records from 
that  company, 
it  obtained  first  place  as  most  popular 
password.)

The disconcerting fact is that the 25 most commonly used 
passwords  for  both  Australia  and  South  Africa  are  either  too 
short or blatantly obvious. International standards recommend 
at  least  eight  characters  with  various  casing  and  special 
characters, mixed in a not-pattern like fashion. From Table II it 
can be seen that this is not applied in practice. 

Table  III  shows  the  top  25  domain  names  found  in  the 
leaked dataset.  Although not conclusive, the amount of unique 
occurrences  of 
the  respective  domains  raises  questions 
regarding the accountability of the involved entities. Should the 
affected  domains  analyze 
the  data  and  notify  other 
organizations  that  could  be  impacted  by  the  breach?  Are  the 
compromised domains responsible to inform their clients that 
they  are  victims  of  a  data  leak?  Although  very  relevant 
questions  about  personally  identifiable  information,  the  in 
depth investigation of these questions are beyond the scope of 
this paper.

VI.  WHY PROTECTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE 

INFORMATION IS CRITICAL 

Besides  the  obvious  concerns  regarding  privacy  in  the 
modern era, several key factors mandate that the accessibility 
of  personally  identifiable  information  be  strictly  controlled. 
Consider  that  something  as  mundane  as  spam  has  a  historic 
open  rate  of  approximately  3%.  In  contrast,  targeted  spear 
phishing attacks have an estimated 70% open rate. In addition, 
research shows that spear phishing victims will actually follow 
links included in the phishing message approximately 50% of 
the  time  [13].  With  the  amount  of  personal  information 
available  on  the  Internet  after  a  data  leak  of  this  magnitude, 
attackers  have  a  lot  of  information  that  can  be  used  to  target 
specific people in spear phishing attacks.  Thus, a data leak can 
actually serve as a catalyst for further cyber attacks. 

Perhaps  one  of  the  most  notable  public  instances  where 
spear phishing has proven its effectiveness was in the breach 
that  occurred  at  the  RSA  security  corporation  in  2011. 
According to an investigative report by Matrix Global Partners 
[14],  the  initial  foothold  into  the  company  was  obtained  by 
sending  spear  phishing  emails.  The  emails  were  crafted  to 
target selected employees and were tailored to align the content 
as  much  as  possible  with  the  individual.      With  leaked  data 
available on the Internet, this becomes relatively easy to do.  

Identity theft is another thriving criminal activity and it is 
not  surprising  that  in  a  country  that  has  a  staggeringly  high 
unemployment rate, South Africa has also seen a huge increase 
in  that  area.  Recent  statistics  place  the  estimated  loss  due  to 
identity  theft  in  the  region of  R1  Billion  per  year  [15]. Once 
again  the  obvious  benefits  for  attackers  from  a  data  leak  are 

 

that the imposter can assume the identity of the victim and with 
as much information as possible available on the Internet after 
a  data  leak,  the  odds  significantly  reduce  the  chance  of 
detection. Taking into account the information available in the 
leaked  dataset,  the  imposter  can  impersonate  any  of  the 
individuals  in  possession  of  a  degree  and  with  reasonable 
certainty  obtain  a  position  or  credit  at  a  less  than  vigilant 
organization. This is an illustration of just one scenario, but the 
scope for identity theft is significantly increased by personally 
identifiable information that is made available on the Internet. 

One  of 

the  main  problems  with  guarding  personal 
information  is  that  the  information  is  so  intrinsically  linked; 
one piece of information can lead to the disclosure of various 
other  pieces  of  information.    Many  online  companies  can 
provide credit, education and employment history checks for a 
nominal  fee  via  either  a  cell  phone  or  ID  number  
(for  example,  visit  http://demo.traceps.co.za).  This  ability  to 
link various pieces of information is due to the South African 
Regulation  of  Interception  of  Communications  and  Provision 
of Communication-Related Information Act (RICA) requiring 
that  cell  phones  and  ID  numbers  be  linked  for  identification 
purposes.  Similarly  it  is  possible  for  law  enforcement  to 
determine  all  required  information  such  as  financial  records 
due to legislation such as the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 
(FICA). Although this aids law enforcement, it also contributes 
to  the  need  to  protect  all  personal  information.  Figure  3 
displays  the  intrinsically  linked  information  that  is  available 
from  a  South  African  ID  number,  using  just  the  Internet. 
Although  the  online  services  do  prohibit  the  use  to  gather 
information  regarding  a  third  party,  it  is  doubtful  that 
determined ID thieves would be deterred.

Consider  research  by  Florencio  and  Herley  [16],  proving 
that  the  average  user  shares  the  same  password  across  3.9 
different accounts. Add to the equation an attacker that has the 

ability  to,  with  the  aid  of  personally  identifiable  information, 
determine what services an individual has subscribed to and the 
scenario  for  estimated  loss  changes  significantly  (both  in 

 

monetary  value  and  potential  identity  compromise).  Even  if 
just  one  of  a  user’s  accounts  combined  with  personally 
identifiable  information  has  been  compromised,  the  impact 
could potentially be felt across a number of related accounts, 
compromising  additional  sensitive  information  (this  is  taking 
into  consideration  Florencio  and  Herley’s  observation  that 
users share the same password across multiple accounts; thus, 
if one account is compromised by means of a password breach, 
there are potentially another three accounts for the same user 
with the same password).  
With the release of the POPI Bill of 2009, it is no longer a case 
of common sense to protect personally identifiable information 
but it will also be a legal requirement. The Bill clearly specifies 
what is considered personally identifiable information (refer to 
Section  III),  the  penalties  involved  for  transgressing  the  law 
and  security  requirements  for  a  company  storing  personal 
information [9]. In this sense, losing/leaking data is expensive 
both  from  a  holistic  view  (refer  to  Figure  3)  and  a  monetary 
perspective.    According  to  research  done  the  cost  of  data 
breaches where personally identifiable information is involved 
has  increased  significantly  to  $3.94  per  record  at  the  lowest 
estimate and to $194 at the highest with an average breach cost 
of $3.7 million, up from $2.4 million in 2001 [17]. In addition, 
the  estimated  revenue  lost  due  to  reduced  customer  loyalty 
after a data leak varies by country but ranges from $289060 in 
India to $3 million in the USA [18]. At the time of writing, no 

official figures for South Africa could be obtained to compare 
the costs of data breaches. 

VII.  LESSONS TO BE LEARNED  

There are a number of lessons to be learned from the South 
African data leak of January 2013.  These lessons can largely 
be mapped against the three areas identified that can potentially 
be impacted by the leak (refer to Section II). 

The first identified impact area relates to human emotions.  
As stated in Section II, at the time of writing the extent of the 
data  leak  was  not  yet  publicly  visualized,  thus  it  is  not  clear 
how  human  emotions  may  impact  people’s  understanding 
thereof.    However,  as  part  of  the  exploratory  process,  the 
authors mapped the timeline (refer to Figure 4) from the date of 
the  data  leak  to  the  date  that  the  data  was  removed  from  the 
Internet  (refer  to  Table  1,  column  Data  Removed).    This  is 
done  for  the  available  datasets  and  is  not  a  reflection  on  the 
companies  involved  in  the  breach.  Due  to  the  nature  of 
personally identifiable information leaked, the authors assume 
that the extended period of time during which the information 
remained  available  on  the  Internet  may  act  as  a  catalyst  for 
human emotions. It should be understood that even though the 
data is removed from the Internet, the attackers that placed it 
there  could  still  have  access  to  the  data.  The  possible  attack 
footprint is reduced by removing the public data but it is not 
removed completely.  

Figure 4.   Timeline of datasets’ availability on the Internet  

 

The  second  identified  impact  area  relates  to  complex 
datasets.  Not only does this paper show that all domains are 
at  risk  (the  leaked  data  affected  government,  petroleum, 
banking,  construction,  management,  networking,  mining, 
transport  services,  education  and  other  enterprises),  but  it 
raises  a  number  of  questions  regarding  the  personally 
identifiable  information  and  the  responsibility  of  those 
entities 
identifiable 
information.    The  intrinsically  linked  nature  of  personally 
identifiable information, as presented in Figure 3, touches on 
the complex nature of these specific datasets.    

tasked  with  handling  personally 

The third identified impact area relates to the processing 
of  unstructured  data  sources.    This  area  emphasizes  the 
important  role  that  legislation  plays  when  working  with 
personally identifiable information – special care should be 
taken  to  ensure  that  South  African  legislation  provides 
unambiguous 
identifiable 
information,  associated  responsibilities  (of  compromised 
companies,  affected  domains  and  victims)  and  measures  of 
protection.

guidance 

on 

Cachin  and  Schunter  [19],  amongst  other  researchers, 
have shown that the rate of attack on companies might have 

decreased  a  bit,  but  the  volume  of  data  leaked  with  each 
attack has grown tremendously. Research institutions such as 
Deloitte  [20]  and  Cibecs  [21]  respectively  present  surveys 
stating  that  53%  of  companies  are  not  ready  for  POPI  and 
26%  of  companies  have  not  even  started  to  prepare. 
Attackers  are  thus  getting  better  at  extracting  information 
from leaked datasets while the victims are still struggling to 
understand  the  legal  requirements  presented  to  them  in  the 
form  of  South  African  legislation.  With  the  data  from  the 
relatively small South African attack presented in this paper, 
it  remains  an  open  question 
if  both  business  and 
administrators are ready for the new laws being signed into 
effect. 

VIII.  CONCLUSION 

leak 

identifiable 

The data leak affecting several South African companies 
has had a significant impact on the way that the security of 
personally 
information  can  be  perceived.  
Compared  to  international  security  breaches,  the  South 
African  data 
is  relatively  small  and  contained.  
However, it provides a number of lessons to be learned from. 
The  information  and  analysis  presented  in  this  paper  is 
the  result  of  research  and  interpretation  performed  by  the 
authors.  The  findings  and  assumptions  are  based  on 
information  that  was  retrieved  from  publicly  accessible 
websites.  The content of the datasets were not verified with 
the affected companies, and as such none of the findings or 
assumptions  made  in  this  paper  are  binding  or  place  an 
obligation or blame on the companies involved. The findings 
are  the  interpretations  of  the  authors,  based  on  publicly 
available information of the data leak. The aim of this paper 
was to loosely analyze the data released from the breach and 
to  visually  present  the  extent  of  the  compromise  to  aid  in 
furthering the importance of implementing and maintaining 
information  security  measures,  as  well  as 
adequate 
awareness 
towards 
responsibility  associated  with 
handling personally identifiable information.

Although  the  nature  of  this  research  is  exploratory,  the 
paper  provides  insight  into  the  value  of  leaked  personally 
identifiable information on the Internet.  It further touches on 
the  contribution  that  South  African  legislation  has  on  the 
intrinsically 
identifiable 
information, and what the resultant impact can be if this type 
of information is made available on the Internet.
